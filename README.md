# Linear Regression Insurance Dataset

This is a project based on a Supervised Machine Learning challenge created by the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp team. The aim was to use simple and multiple linear regression on an insurance.csv dataset. This dataset is fictitional and created by the HyperionDev team for the purposes of the challenge. 

The Simple Linear Regression model plots age against insurance charges and the model is used to make predictions (e.g. on age) beyond the actual data. 

The Multiple Linear Regression model is also plotted for age against insurance charges, whereby the model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20% in order to make predictions.
